# Breast Cancer Diagnosis using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant based on features extracted from cell nuclei.

## Project Overview

Goal: Predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## Requirements

-Python 3.x

-scikit-learn

-pandas

-matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries 
3. Run knnbc.py to train the model and make predictions.

## Results
