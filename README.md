Breast Cancer Diagnosis using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant based on features extracted from cell nuclei.

Project Overview
Dataset: Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset.
Goal: Predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.
Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Requirements
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
pandas
matplotlib
How to Run
Clone the repository.
Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run knn_breast_cancer.py to train the model and make predictions.
Results
The model achieves high accuracy in predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant.
